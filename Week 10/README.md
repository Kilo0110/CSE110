# Week 10 Assignment Solution By Divine Ahaka

## Project Description

For this project you will create a program that stores a list of products in a shopping cart along with their prices. The user should have the ability to add items to the list, remove them, and see the total price of the cart.

For the milestone deliverable, you only need to worry about storing a list of the names of the items (not the prices yet), and only need to be able to add new items and display the list. Then, for the complete project, you'll add the ability to store the prices, remove items, and compute the total.

## My Implementation

Adhering to the project's requirement, I have created a shopping cart program that allows user to add new items to their cart, give a price for that item, view all the items in their cart, remove items and calculate the total amount of all the items in their cart. Furthermore, I have added an extra feature that allows the user to clear the screen when it becomes messy and cluttered.

I have also put in place multiple checks and failsafe to monitor when a user might input an invalid option and to communicate that error to the user and avoiding it breaking the code.

In addition, in development I have made use of a custom Item class that allows me to quickly create new instances of an item when it is created. I have also made use of recursion to continuously allow the user to input in new options after an action has being completed and to then evaluate that option.
