# CSEPC 110 WEEK 4 PROVE ASSIGNMENT - BY DIVINE AHAKA

In this program, I have created a meal price calculator that takes in, as inputs, the prices of meals for adults and children and then determines how much it will cost in total. To show creativity, I have added a randomly generated discount that is given to each user and can be used to save extra cash if the user pleases. I have also extended the displayed information to include the discount and bills and the change or money owed.
